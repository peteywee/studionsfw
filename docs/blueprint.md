# **App Name**: Vision Weaver

## Core Features:

- Image Upload & Prompt Generation: Upload an image. The image will be processed to generate prompts for creating alternative image renderings with generative AI, by acting as a tool.
- Artistic Transformation: Apply style transformation. The uploaded image can be transformed based on the prompt (e.g. 'Realistic Unveiled', 'Anime-Style Unveiled') via Genkit flows and Vertex AI Imagen. User will be able to preview the generated images and choose the result that satisfies their expectation.
- Text-to-Image Generation: Generate images from scratch. Generate an entirely new image from a user's text prompt using Vertex AI Imagen through Genkit.
- Image Display: Display image variations. Render original and generated images in a visually appealing gallery.
- Interactive Controls: Handle user interactions by providing simple, clear and responsive controls for image uploads, style selections and generative processes.
- Feedback & Error Handling: Manage and communicate asynchronous image processing status, ensuring users are informed about loading or potential errors in Genkit flows and Vertex AI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0BFFF) to evoke creativity and calm.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F0F0) for a clean, distraction-free canvas.
- Accent color: Muted rose (#E0B0B0) for highlighting actions and providing visual interest.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for artistic flair. Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) for readability.
- Use minimalist line icons to represent actions like 'upload,' 'transform,' and 'generate.'
- Employ a grid-based layout to present images in a structured and responsive manner.
- Subtle transitions when switching between original and generated images to enhance the user experience.
